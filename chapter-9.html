                <p class="texts">In 2021, aviation emissions were estimated to be around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), 
                 8% reduction from 2020 levels.<br> The reduction was primarily due to suppressed demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Emissions in 2021 were 62% lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2019. 
                 <br>International flights accounted for 89% of aviation emissions in 2021, with domestic flights at 4% and military flights at 7%. It is unclear how demand for air travel will evolve in the coming years, especially in light of high oil prices and rising costs of living.</p>
